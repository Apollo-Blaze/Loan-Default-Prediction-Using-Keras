# Loan Default Prediction Using Keras

This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at predicting loan defaults using historical data from LendingClub. The project leverages the Keras API to build and train a neural network model.

## Project Overview

LendingClub is a US peer-to-peer lending company. This project uses a subset of LendingClub's data to predict whether a borrower will repay their loan or default. The dataset includes various features such as loan amount, interest rate, employment length, and more.

## Data

The dataset used in this project is obtained from Kaggle: [LendingClub DataSet](https://www.kaggle.com/wordsforthewise/lending-club). It contains information on loans given out, including whether the borrower defaulted (charge-off).

## Goals

- **Predict Loan Default**: Build a model to predict whether a borrower will repay their loan.
- **Feature Analysis**: Understand which features are most important in predicting loan default.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model using classification metrics.

## Results
The modelâ€™s performance is evaluated using various classification metrics. The results and visualizations are included in the Jupyter notebook.

## Acknowledgements
LendingClub for providing the dataset.
